# Eth export tools

Use geth as a library to export state, lots of trial and error here...

* cmd/export-accounts exports accounts from a local geth node
* cmd/export-proofs exports account proofs from a local geth node
* cmd/experiment-dataset generates the pir formatted data for account and proof serving
